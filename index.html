			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<h2>Intro</h2>
			<p>My name is <strong>Douganahue</strong>. I am 287 years old, and my birthday is on Octember 289. I go to Roblox Academy for school. I have parents from the universe that came to the Milky Way and have an older dragon that is at Roblox Academy as a Junebug.</p>
			<h2>What I like</h2>
			<p>I like to play sports. some of these sports include sleeping and meming. I do Memology and 3D Meme Animation in Roblox Academy, and also hope to make it into the Roblox Eating Team. In 3D Meme Animation I do the 1,000,000 mile run and sometimes the 2,000,000,000,000 mile run.</p>
			<p>I also like to play Video Games. some of these games include Fortnite made by <a href="https://www.epicgames.com">Epic Games</a> and <a href="https://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>. I like these games because I can use creativity while still having action. I play many other games that are also fun.</p>
			<p>One of my hobbies include art. I like art because it lets me make an imaginary world. I have an out-of-school art class that I go to every single Friday. I enjoy the art class because the people there are nice and fun to work with.</p>
			<p>There is more information about me in the links on the left side of the page. There you can find my Favorite Cars and More.</p>
